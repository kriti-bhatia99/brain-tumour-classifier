# Brain Tumour Classifier

A convolutional neural network trained to classify brain scan images into:
- No tumour
- Glioma tumour
- Meningioma tumour
- Pituitary tumour

The network is integrated with a Flask application to create a user friendly website to upload the scans and get the prediction from the model along with the probability.
